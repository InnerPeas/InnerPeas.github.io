<p> I am a Term Assistant Professor at Columbia University. Before joining Columbia, I obtained my PhD in Mathematical Finance at Carnegie Mellon University, under the supervision of <a href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~jmuhleka/">Prof. Johannes Muhle-Karbe </a>. I am mainly interested in stochastic optimization and stochastic differential equations with applications to mathematical finance. I have also worked on various topics in data science, including crowdsourcing, dimensionality reduction, and sparse recovery. 
I was a visiting student at the Simons Institute Foundations of Data Science program.
