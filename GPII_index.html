<strong>Academic Integrity</strong>:



People caught cheating generally tell a story about being unable to keep up
with the material. Remember that if there is something going on in your life that makes it hard for you to
keep up, please let me know. That brings me to the following point.

<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Take Care of Yourself</strong>:
It is easy for me to say and hard for all
of us, including me, to do, but taking care of your physical and mental health is
essential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Life is a marathon, and you need to pace yourself.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

If you or anyone you know experiences extreme academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek
support. Counseling and Psychological Services is here to help 24/7, and everything will be confidential: 
<a href="https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/">https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/</a><br/>
 
In addition, consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family
member you trust for help getting connected to the support. Keep in mind that
for serious psychological issues, the first counselor you meet with may not be the
right one for you, but this does not mean you should give up on counseling. Keep
looking for someone who can help you. <ul>

<li> If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call
immediately, day or night:<br/>

Non-urgent campus police: 416-978-2323<br/>

<li> If the situation is life threatening, call the police:<br/>

Urgent campus police: 416-978-2222 <br/>

Off campus: 911<br/>

</ul>
If you have questions about this advice, your coursework, or anything else
about which I might be helpful, please let me know.
