<strong>Course Description</strong>: TThe course will provide an introduction to machine learning and its core models and algorithms. The aim of the course is to 
provide students of statistics with detailed knowledge of
how machine learning methods work and how statistical models can be brought to bear in computer systems---not only to analyze
large data sets, but to let computers perform tasks that traditional methods of computer science are unable to address. 
Examples range from speech recognition and text analysis through bioinformatics and medical diagnosis.
This course provides a first introduction to the statistical methods and mathematical concepts which make such technologies possible.
  
<br/>
<strong>Course Prerequisites</strong>: 
Statistics, (Calculus based) Probability, Linear Regression Models, Linear Algebra.
<br/>






<br/>
<strong>Homework</strong>: 

  There will be four homework assignments, approximately evenly spaced throughout the semester. The homework will be posted on <a href="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu">CourseWork</a>.   We will also use  <a href="https://courseworks2.columbia.edu">CourseWork</a> for submitting and grading. We highly recommend using the discussion function on Coursework for discussion. 
  Homeworks submitted after the deadline will not be considered, so please plan in advance. In the case of an emergency (sudden sickness, family problems, etc.), a reasonable extension will be assigned. But we emphasize that this is reserved for true emergencies.
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Evaluation</strong>: 
40% for Homework average + 40% for Project + 20% for Final.

<h3>Logistics</h3>
<strong>Policy on Late Homework</strong>:
All homework submitted after the solution is not going to be graded and you will receive zero credit for that homework. 
<br/>
<br/>      
<strong>Policy on Collaboration</strong>:
You are encouraged to work together on
the homework. Discussing the homework problems with one another can be a
valuable learning experience. However, it is a violation of the rules on academic
integrity to copy another student's solution and submit it as your own. \textbf{You
should write up your solutions separately, not referring to a common document}.
Furthermore, you should not submit any work that you do not fully understand.
You should be able to start with a clean sheet of paper and without notes or
assistance write out the solution to any homework solution you submit. If you will
do that with every homework you submit, the similarity between your solutions
and those of other students will not arouse suspicion. More importantly, you will
be well prepared for the exams. You are not permitted to use homework solutions for this course from previous
years or solutions you find from other sources, including the internet.
<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Take Care of Yourself</strong>:It is easy for me to say and hard for all
of us, including me, to do, but taking care of your physical and mental health is
essential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Life is a marathon, and you need to pace yourself.
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.<br/>

If you or anyone you know experiences extreme academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek
support. Counseling and Psychological Services is here to help 24/7, and everything will be confidential: call 212-854-2878 or visit 
<a href="\texttt{https://health.columbia.edu/content/counseling-and-psychological-services}">here</a>. <br/>


In addition, consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family
member you trust for help getting connected to the support. Keep in mind that
for serious psychological issues, the first counselor you meet with may not be the
right one for you, but this does not mean you should give up on counseling. Keep
looking for someone who can help you.<br/>

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call
immediately, day or night:<ul>

Counseling and Psychological Services: 212-854-2878<br/>

If the situation is life threatening, call the police:<ul>

<li>On campus: Columbia Police: 212-854-2797<br/>

<li>Off campus: 911</ul>
</ul>


If you have questions about this advice, your coursework, or anything else
about which I might be helpful, please let me know.
